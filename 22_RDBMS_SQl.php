// Introduction

// The next series of tutorials is about databases. Before making our hands dirty with creating databases in Php, we have to cover some theoretical portion about databases.

// In this lesson, you will learn about Introduction to the database, RDBMS, MSQL, and the advantages of storing data in the form of tables.

// What is Database
// A database is a kind of storage usually implemented inside a server for small-scale applications and outside the server if the data is huge or complex in size.

// In website development, most of the data is fetched and stored in the database at the server-side.

// There are many types of database systems that have been developed since now. The choice among different database systems depends upon the nature of the application. Here in this lesson and for the rest of this course, we will be following MYSQL. We will discuss it in the next sections.

// What is RDBMS
// RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management Systems. It is the basis for SQL and all other modern database languages. RDBMS stores data in tables, with most commercial relational database management systems using Structured Query Language (SQL) to access the database.

// A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as introduced by E. F. Codd.

// Introduction to SQL
// SQL is a standard language (Structured Query Language) for storing, retrieving, and manipulating data in the database.

// There are some terms that need to be defined related to Database tables. Consider the following table for the next terms.


// What is a table?
// A table is a structured form of data. The data is stored in the form of database objects called tables. The basic building blocks of a table are rows and columns. Refer to the table above. Suppose the name of the above table is Employees.

// What is a field?
// A table is divided into smaller entities called fields. In the above employees' table, ID, NAME, AGE, ADDRESS, and SALARY are its fields.

// What is a Row or Record?

// Record is also known as a row of data. For example, in the Employees table above, there are 7 rows of data refer to as 7 records alternatively.



// What is a column?
// Each vertical entity of the database table is named a column. In the Employees table, we have 5 columns.

// Why prefer Tables over File system to store data
// Data can also be stored in the files. But there are many complexities that arise with the passage of time, so computer developers have to introduce and prefer DB over file systems.

// The file system does not support quick searching of data.
// The file system is not efficient for millions of records.
// The file system cannot develop relationship between data.
// Data cannot be filtered from the files.
